      <span className="title">Google Stadia</span><br></br><br></br>

While Google seeks to pioneer on other fronts besides their utilities, it may hit a few hiccups. In this case one of those was Google Stadia. Google Stadia was Google's introduction to cloud gaming. It includes a wide range of games that are available for free if you paid for the $9.99 subscription with various options to play certain selected games for thirty minutes for free. However, Google Stadia was indubitably not that impressive.<br></br>

<br></br>While Google Stadia was a nice extension to Google at first, there isn’t anything partially special about the gaming cloud software. It has a partially bad business model, it lacked the incentive to obtain the feedback from its players, and it was never as big as its competitor GeForce Now. This was in part, due to Google not pushing the latest games and only uploading small indie games. <br></br>

<br></br>However, above all of Google Stadia’s hiccups, it still had one of the most influential and critical problems that a lot of cloud computing softwares have. It has incredibly high input lag. Many players were plagued with disconnects, latency, and input lag that were ultimately incredibly difficult to settle down.

<span className="title">Lightshot</span> <br></br>

<br></br>Lightshot is a revolutionary tool for screenshots. It’s hard to grasp how exactly a screenshot tool could revolutionize the rest of its industry for screenshots, but Lightshot really knew what they were thinking when they combined a not only a customizable and easy to use resizable window, but also included various additional options.<br></br>

<br></br>Originally launched in 2014, the first stable version of Lightshot might not have been the grandest. However, over the years the company has faced its challenges and has now ended up with a very nice piece of software with over one million downloads across various platforms. <br></br>

<br></br>Some of the unique uses of lightshot include the ability to resize the window panel of  a screenshot. As well as resize, one can add arrows, lines, and draw whatever they want inside the screenshot with the pencil tool. One can simply download, copy, or download the screenshot right from the application in a matter of seconds. <br></br>

<br></br>I personally use lightshot in everyday use. Whether that be for homework, to extensive research projects, lightshot has always been a viable and useful tool to help me finish and complete my tasks. <br></br>

<br></br><span className="title">Tokens vs. Coins</span><br></br><br></br>

Over the years the rise of cryptocurrency has resulted in an assortment of unique solutions to finance, apps, and many more tools. However, the one major misconception is the difference between a coin and token on any given blockchain. This misunderstanding has confused the likes of beginners just starting out in the new blockchain world. The difference between the two is vital and shouldn’t be overlooked.<br></br>

<br></br>A coin is essentially just a blockchain itself. Blockchain is just a distributed ledger of parent participants. Simply put, it is a large database with records that keep pouring into it every second. The database is upheld by thousands and thousands of servers. A blockchain can only have one coin, its main central figure. For example, the famous Bitcoin is a blockchain. The name of the coin and the name of the blockchain are both Bitcoin. <br></br>

<br></br>On the other side of the spectrum a token refers to something else. A token lives within a blockchain, similar to a coin, however it is not binded by only having one. There could be hundreds of thousands of different types of tokens with different features all running on one blockchain. However, there can only be one coin. <br></br>

<br></br>The reason people get confused has a lot to do with the names. The names of each of these cryptos can confuse any user and make them think that a token is really just a coin at first glance. For example, a lot of people might think XRP is a coin due to its high volume and market cap that is outperforming top coins on the market. This is actually just a simple token that represents the framework for the Ripple Network. <br></br>
<br></br><span className="title">The Revolution of Yield Farming</span><br></br><br></br>

<br></br>Yield farming has slowly gained popularity over the past two years or so and is changing the way that modern day people handle finances. Imagine a world where you deposit your money into your safe and secure crypto DAPP (decentralized app) and earn more than you would lend your money out to a bank just for sitting there. That is where yield farming comes in.

<br></br>We all know how banks take our money and we earn anywhere as low as 0.07% a year on APY. Well in yield farming, you are the bank. Literally you hand out your money and loan it to others to earn an APY back, however it is important to note that this APY doesn’t have to be taken out yearly, it can be done monthly. <br></br>

<br></br>It might be hard to understand how this is all possible. Let’s say that some user wants to take out a loan in Aave. Aave is a highly transferable open source liquidity protocol that is used widely in yield farming due to its secureness and attractive interest rates. You might be wondering, how do I know that I am going to get my money back? This is done by the user placing collateral on the transaction. Let’s say he has five million Dogecoin, but he wants to take out a loan in Aave. He might give up his dogecoin as collateral, meaning he won’t be able to use it at all and if he doesn't pay it back, you the “bank” will obtain the Dogecoin.<br></br>

<br></br>I hope that Yield Farming will become more widely adopted, especially since you can farm just about any coin including safecoins. Safecoins are coins or tokens that are pegged to some actual tangible currency. For example, USD tether (USDT) is pegged to the dollar. You can trust that it’s going to stay at a good rate.<br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br>
